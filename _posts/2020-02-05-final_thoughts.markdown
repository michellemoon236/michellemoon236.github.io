I have come to the end of my online coding bootcamp experience. It was both more exciting and challenging than I anticipated. I come away with a deep respect for programming in general. Behind the scenes the complexity of what it takes to accurately represent the world in code is fascinating and the possibilities of what coding can do to help so many different aspects of society, people groups, and society is limitless. 

I am also proud of myself for saying yes to this journey of exploring this new field and diving fully in. There were times it felt overwhelming and confusing, but staying the course and continually getting back up again was such a valuable experience. It was also such a unique experience to learn in an online environment and have a mentor and classmates from all over the country. Journeying with this group of people, encouraging and supporting each other along the way was one of my favorite parts of the program.
