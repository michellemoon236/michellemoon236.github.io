A good friend came up to me 2 years ago and said, “Have you ever thought about learning coding? I think you would like it.” And with that seed, my journey into the world of coding began. From that simple question, I began to be curious about the field of coding and started reading blogs, watching youtube videos, and taking some free classes online. Then I started to look seriously into programs after considering many options I decided to enroll in Flatiron’s Online Software Engineering Program. It has been about one month into the program and I am so happy with it. The learn.co curriculum is excellent with thorough instruction and ample labs to consistently practice what you are learning. And I was pleasantly surprised with the incredible support the program provides from regular meetings with both a technical mentor to help learn coding and also an educational coach to help process and strategize how I can learn best and intentionally succeed in this program.

Going into a new career field can be a daunting decision, but I believe saying yes to the journey to continue to explore who you are and find things that make you come alive is important and brave.  I am learning coding because I am developing a passion for it and it embodies things I naturally have a liking toward including solving problems, building structure, and working in teams. Coding in itself is fascinating to me because it is about creating ways to represent the real world into computer instructions that can open up a world of possibilities of beneficial outcomes such as finding a place to eat nearby, connecting you with a group of friends with similar interests, and having podcasts of any topic available to you at your fingertips. What I also love about coding is touches all areas of society. Web applications are growing to be needed everywhere such as in government, schools, hospitals, businesses, etc. By learning to code, there is potential to touch and be a part of improving a wide variety of fields.
